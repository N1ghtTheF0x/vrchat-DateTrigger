# DateTrigger

Enable/disable game objects based on time and/or date of the VRChat Servers

See [this][install-path] for installation

## How To

Check [the guide][guide-path] (GUIDE.md)

## Why are some values `-1`

`-1` means to not check for these values. If one is `-1` but the other one is something else, then it will still not check

## Inclusive Vs. Exclusive

Inclusive means to *include* the boundaries as possible values  
Exclusive means to *exclude* the boundaries as possible values

### Example

Let's say we have a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 15

Inclusive = the number is 0 or 15 or between those values  
Exclusive = the number is *only* between 0 and 15, but not those values

You can change stuff, BUT you have to credit my name in your world somewhere or I'll do some nasty stuff >:)  
(Also with "credit my name" I mean putting this image [n1ghtthef0x.png] somewhere in the world, username is optional)
